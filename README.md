# Data Science Foundations - Final Project

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to determine if lap times of cars at a specific race track can be predicted based on basic information about the cars. Motor racing is a highly data driven sport, especially at the highest levels,
so the ability to collect and accurately analyze data to make improvements or predictions is crucial to victory. This project looks at multiple regression techniques, a simple neural net, and hyperparameter tuning with grid
search to produce the best result possible with limited data.

## Selection of Data
The data for this project is a small dataset of the fastest lap times for different cars at the Leguna Seca racetrack in California. The original data was scraped from
